# Command Post Plan: Financial Data Analysis Skills

## What We Are Building

Two Claude Code slash commands that form a "command post" for fetching, comparing, and validating financial data for retail companies in the BusMgmtBenchmarks project.

---

## Background

The BusMgmtBenchmarks project tracks financial data for 50+ retail companies in a Dolt database at `calvinw/BusMgmtBenchmarks/main`. The `financials` table stores 13 fields per company per year (see schema below).

We discovered that pulling data from different sources (SEC filings, Yahoo Finance) produces inconsistent values for the same fields — especially SGA — because companies report line items differently. For example, TheRealReal reports SGA, Marketing, and Operations & Technology as three separate lines, while Walmart rolls everything into one SGA line. A naive extraction picks up the wrong number.

The old `/fetch-financials` command (which used a local Python XBRL pipeline) has been deleted. We replaced it with two smarter skills built around remote MCP servers.

## Available Data Sources

| Source | How to access | What it returns |
|---|---|---|
| SEC 10-K filings | `mcp-sec-10ks` MCP → `process_financial_data_from_sec(company_name, year, cik)` | Income statement + balance sheet from official SEC filing for a specific year |
| Yahoo Finance | `mcp-yfinance-10ks` MCP → `process_financial_data_from_yahoo(company_name, ticker)` | Income statement + balance sheet, 4 years of history |
| Dolt DB | `mcp__claude_ai_Dolt_Database_MCP__read_query` → SQL against `calvinw/BusMgmtBenchmarks/main` | Existing rows in the `financials` table |
| Daloopa | financial-analysis plugin (free tier, not yet authenticated) | Structured financial data — add as Source D once connected |

Both MCP servers are already registered and show as Connected in `claude mcp list`.

## The Two Skills

### `/analyze-financials TICKER YEAR`

The main command post. Does everything except write to the database.

**Workflow:**
1. Query Dolt `company_info` table by `ticker_symbol` to get `company` (exact DB name) and `CIK`
2. Fetch from SEC and Yahoo in parallel; also query existing Dolt row
3. Extract the 13 standard fields from each source
4. Run anomaly detection (see rules below)
5. Build side-by-side comparison table across all sources
6. Produce reconciled recommendation with reasoning for each field
7. Signal ready for `/insert-financials`
8. Save markdown report to `skills/reports/{TICKER}-{YEAR}.md` (gitignored)

**Key anomaly detection rules:**

- **SGA Composite Rule 1** — If SEC filing has both `us-gaap_SellingGeneralAndAdministrativeExpense` AND `us-gaap_MarketingExpense` as separate lines → recommended SGA = SGA + Marketing (matches how traditional retailers report)
- **SGA Composite Rule 2** — If SEC filing has a company-specific ops/tech line (e.g. `real_OperationsAndTechnologyExpense`) → exclude from SGA for marketplace companies; it is a platform infrastructure cost
- **SGA Composite Rule 3** — If Yahoo SGA ≈ Total Operating Expenses from SEC → Yahoo is summing everything; don't use Yahoo for SGA
- **SGA Composite Rule 4** — If no combined SGA tag but G&A + Selling reported separately → sum them
- **Never include** `us-gaap_RestructuringCharges` in SGA
- **Restatements** — Later filings restate prior year numbers; always use the most recent version
- **Negative equity** — Valid but flag explicitly (TheRealReal, heavily leveraged companies)
- **Gross margin sanity** — Discount/warehouse: 10–30%; Dept store/specialty: 30–50%; Marketplace/consignment: 60–80%
- **Balance sheet identity** — Total Assets must equal Total Liabilities + Total SE

**Prototype case — TheRealReal FY2024:**
- SEC raw SGA: $187,737K
- SEC Marketing: $55,256K
- SEC Ops & Tech: $260,827K (platform cost — exclude)
- Recommended SGA for DB: $243,000K (SGA + Marketing only)
- Dolt DB had $485,571K (was including Ops & Tech — incorrect)
- Yahoo had $503,820K (summed all operating expenses — not usable)

---

### `/insert-financials TICKER YEAR`

Run after `/analyze-financials` in the same session (relies on context from that run).

**This skill generates a SQL file only. It never connects to or writes to any database.**

**Workflow:**
1. Take the reconciled values from the analysis
2. Convert to thousands (÷ 1,000) — DB stores values in thousands
3. Write SQL REPLACE INTO statement to `extract/2026/inserts/TICKER_YEAR_insert.sql`
4. Show the SQL for human review
5. Print instructions for applying manually:
   - `cd` into the local Dolt repo clone
   - Run `dolt sql < extract/2026/inserts/TICKER_YEAR_insert.sql`
   - Verify with `dolt diff`
   - Commit with `dolt commit -m "..."`
   - Push with `dolt push` when ready

**Why this design:** Keeps the skill simple and safe. The human decides when and whether to apply the SQL. No risk of accidental overwrites or bad pushes to DoltHub.

## Database Schema

Table: `financials` in `calvinw/BusMgmtBenchmarks/main`

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `company_name` | Full name (e.g. "The RealReal", "Walmart") |
| `year` | Fiscal year integer (e.g. 2024) |
| `reportDate` | Fiscal year end date (e.g. 2024-12-31) |
| `Net Revenue` | |
| `Cost of Goods` | Positive value |
| `Gross Margin` | Derived: Revenue − COGS |
| `SGA` | See composite rules above |
| `Operating Profit` | Can be negative |
| `Net Profit` | Can be negative |
| `Inventory` | NULL for pure marketplace companies |
| `Current Assets` | |
| `Total Assets` | |
| `Current Liabilities` | |
| `Liabilities` | Derived: Total Assets − Total SE |
| `Total Shareholder Equity` | Can be negative |
| `Total Liabilities and Shareholder Equity` | Must equal Total Assets |

**All values stored in thousands of dollars.**

Company metadata (name, CIK, ticker, segment) is in the `company_info` table.

## Skill File Structure

Skills are stored in the repo under `skills/commands/` so collaborators can install them. The canonical install location on any machine is `~/.claude/commands/`.

```
skills/
├── commands/                        ← committed to repo; source of truth

└── COMMAND_POST_PLAN.md             ← this file
```

`~/.claude/commands/` is where Claude Code looks for slash commands. `setup.sh` copies everything from `skills/commands/` there.

---

## Report Publishing Workflow

1. `/analyze-financials TICKER YEAR` → saves `skills/reports/{TICKER}-{YEAR}.md` (local, gitignored)
2. `bash skills/reports/generate-html-report.sh TICKER YEAR` → creates `skills/reports/{TICKER}-{YEAR}.html`
3. Commit and push the HTML → GitHub Actions copies it to `docs/reports/` during build
4. Published at: `https://calvinw.github.io/BusMgmtBenchmarks/reports/{TICKER}-{YEAR}.html`

---

## Collaborator Setup (One Script)

Any collaborator who clones the repo runs a single command from the repo root:

```bash
bash skills/setup.sh
```

This script does three things in order:
1. **Copies skill directories** from `skills/commands/` → `~/.claude/commands/` (creates dir if needed)
2. **Registers MCP servers** — `mcp-yfinance-10ks` and `mcp-sec-10ks` via SSE
3. **Verifies** Claude Code can see both MCP servers and prints confirmation

After running it, the collaborator opens Claude Code and `/analyze-financials` and `/insert-financials` are immediately available.

**To update skills** (e.g. after a `git pull` that adds new anomaly rules): re-run `bash skills/setup.sh` — it overwrites the installed copies with the latest from the repo.

---

## Architecture Principles

- **Command post model** — `/analyze-financials` is the hub; sources are plugged in. Adding Daloopa = add one fetch step, one column in the comparison table.
- **Anomaly rules grow over time** — Every new company pattern discovered gets added to `skills/commands/analyze-financials/references/anomaly-rules.md` and committed to the repo
- **Human review always required before DB write** — `/insert-financials` is always a separate step with explicit confirmation
- **Skills chain within a session** — Run `/analyze-financials` then `/insert-financials` in the same Claude Code session; context carries forward
- **Skills travel with the repo** — skill files are plain text committed to git; any collaborator gets the same version after running `setup.sh`
- **Reports are publishable** — HTML reports committed to `skills/reports/` are automatically published to GitHub Pages on push

---

## Current Status

- `/analyze-financials` and `/insert-financials` skills fully built and working
- Remote MCPs registered: `mcp-yfinance-10ks` and `mcp-sec-10ks` (SSE)
- `setup.sh` installs skills and registers MCPs in one command
- Report pipeline working: markdown → HTML via pandoc + report.css → GitHub Pages
- TheRealReal FY2023 and FY2024 validated and reports published
- Daloopa planned as Source D but not yet connected (requires authentication)
