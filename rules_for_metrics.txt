Sign Conventions

1. Display Rules:
- Convert negative to positive for display: Net Revenue, Cost of Goods, SG&A, Inventory, Current Assets, Total Assets, Current Liabilities, Total Shareholder Equity, Total Liabilities
(can mean remove parentheses)
- Preserve signs: Operating Profit, Net Profit

2. Calculation Rules:
- Use absolute values: Cost of Goods, SG&A, balance sheet items
- Preserve signs: Operating Profit, Net Profit for margin calculations

3. Formulas:

Gross Margin = Revenue - Cost of Goods
Liabilities =  (Total Liabilites and Shareholder Equity) - Total Shareholder Equity 
Cost of Goods % = Cost of Goods / Revenue × 100
Gross Margin % = Gross Margin / Revenue × 100
SG&A % = SG&A / Revenue × 100
Operating Profit Margin % = Operating Profit / Revenue × 100
Net Profit Margin % = Net Profit / Revenue × 100
Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods / Average Inventory
Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Total Assets
Return on Assets % = Net Profit / Average Total Assets × 100
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
Debt to Equity = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholder Equity
3-Year CAGR = (Final Value / Initial Value)^(1/3) - 1 × 100 (uses 4 years of data but time span is 3 years , so for example 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021 would be needed for CAGR with current year 2024)
```

Signs in results:
- Margins and ROA will be negative if profit is negative
- Other ratios are typically positive unless components are negative
