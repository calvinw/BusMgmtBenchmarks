# TEMPLATE_VARIABLE GIVING THE UNITS (Was hard for LLM to find) 

units="thosands" (or "millions" or "dollars")

# THE PROMPT IS BELOW

prompt = f"""Below is a list of financial concepts related to the income sheet part of a 10-K report. Can you find the following concepts and values for the latest year (marked as "12 Months Ended" usually)

CONCEPTS:
Net Revenue
Cost of Goods
SG&A
Operating Profit
Net Profit

THE HTML FOR THE INCOME STATEMENT:
```html
{html_content}
```

Here is an example of how the label is found in the html text:
{income_label_example}

Here the label is "Net income(loss)"

The units for this report are in:
{units}

So you need to adjust all numbers to be in units of Thousands.

- If the numbers are giving in Thousands you can use as is. 
- If the numbers are given in Millions, then multiply by 1000. 
- If the units are in dollars, then divide by 1000. 

Response format:
```json
[
   {{
       'label': 'Total Revenue',
       'concept': 'Net Revenue',
       'value':  a number,
       'name': "us-gaap_RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax"
   }}
   ... other concepts and values...
]
```
"""

NOTE:

Note you have to put in {{ and }} to get one { and } since you are using f-strings and the formating code inside an f-string requires it.
